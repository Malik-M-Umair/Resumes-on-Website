    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
    
        
        During my tenure as a Software Engineer at Tech Innovators Inc., from June 2021 to August 2023, I led the development of a scalable cloud-based inventory management system that improved the efficiency of client operations by 30%. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and implement microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes, resulting in enhanced system reliability and performance. My role also involved optimizing SQL database queries, which reduced data retrieval times by 40%. Additionally, I played a key part in developing and deploying a customer-facing mobile application using React Native, which received positive user feedback for its intuitive interface and robust functionality. My experience at Tech Innovators Inc. has equipped me with a strong foundation in software development, team collaboration, and project management.</p>
